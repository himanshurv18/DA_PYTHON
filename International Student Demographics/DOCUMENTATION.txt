Summary and conclusion:

The analysis of the International Student Demographics dataset revealed several key insights. The overall number of international students has shown a consistent upward trend, with a temporary decline during the COVID period. The top 10 countries contributing to international student enrollment were visualized using a stacked bar chart, highlighting variations over the years.

Academic type popularity indicated that undergraduate and graduate programs are the most preferred among international students. Academic level distribution revealed that Bachelor's and Master's degrees collectively account for nearly 50% of the students.

The distribution across origin regions showed Asia, particularly East Asia, as the primary contributor. Personal and Family funding sources were predominant, with U.S. colleges or universities ranking second. In terms of visas, F-Visas dominated with a staggering 91.6%, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of visa types in the international student population.

Takeaway: The findings suggest a consistent demand for undergraduate and graduate programs, particularly in Asia. Institutions should focus on personalized and family-based funding solutions, and understanding the prevalence of F-Visas is crucial for effective international student support.
