Conculsion

The analysis reveals key patterns: City hotels face higher cancellations, urging focused interventions in early-month periods. Repeated guests exhibit loyalty with fewer cancellations, while both hotel types favor weeknight stays. Discrepancies in room assignments highlight a need for consistency. ADR remains stable but slightly higher in City hotels. Seasonal revenue peaks from January to August, emphasizing the need for strategies in slower periods. Personalized services reduce cancellations and potentially boost ADR, while parking demands primarily align with specific customer types. Implementing targeted interventions to mitigate cancellations, tailor offerings, and manage seasonal revenue can optimize hotel performance and guest satisfaction.
